## Plan: {title}

### Goal
{one-sentence objective}

### Intent Type
{Trivial | Refactor | Build | Mid-sized | Architecture | Research}

### Scope
- In: {explicitly included}
- Out: {explicitly excluded}
- Must Have:
  - {required item}
- Must NOT Have:
  - {guardrail / excluded work}

### Context (Evidence)
- {path}: {relevant pattern/constraint}
- {path}: {relevant dependency/behavior}

### Assumptions
- {assumption}

### Execution Strategy (Parallel Waves)
- **Wave 1**: {independent foundation tasks}
- **Wave 2**: {parallel tasks depending on wave 1}
- **Wave N**: {integration/finalization}

### Task Breakdown
1. **{task title}** — Complexity: {Low|Medium|High}
   - What:
   - Where: `path/to/file` (symbol/area)
   - Depends on:
   - Blocks:
   - Risks:
   - Acceptance checks:
     - `command or check`
     - Expected: `{explicit expected result}`

2. **{task title}** — Complexity: {Low|Medium|High}
   - What:
   - Where:
   - Depends on:
   - Blocks:
   - Risks:
   - Acceptance checks:
     - `command or check`
     - Expected: `{explicit expected result}`

### Test & QA Scenarios
- [ ] Happy path: {scenario} → expected: {result}
- [ ] Failure/edge path: {scenario} → expected: {result}

### Edge Cases & Risks
- {risk} → {mitigation}

### Decisions Needed
- {question that requires user choice}

### Defaults Applied
- {reasonable default used}; override by user if needed

### Estimated Total Effort
{rough estimate}
